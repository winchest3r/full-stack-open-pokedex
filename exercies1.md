## Exercise 10.1

So, with Java we have to think all aspects of CI setup. One of the primary tasks is to implement linting and static code analysis. Tools like Checkstyle, Lightrun, and PMD are instrumental in automating the detection of errors, warnings, and style inconsistencies in the codebase. These tools help maintain code quality and enforce coding standards, thereby reducing the likelihood of bugs and improving overall code maintainability.

Testing is another critical component of a robust CI setup. For unit and integration testing JUnit can be used. It is essential for verifying that individual units of code and their integrations work as intended. For end-to-end testing, Playwright can be utilized. Playwright is a powerful tool for testing web applications across different browsers, and it ensures that the entire application workflow functions correctly.

In terms of building the project, tools like Maven and Gradle are indispensable. These build automation tools manage the project's dependencies, compile the code, and package the application.

For the CI server, while Jenkins is a popular choice, alternatives like JetBrains' TeamCity offer robust solutions with a free version available.

Choosing between a self-hosted CI environment and a cloud-based solution depends on the project's requirements. Self-hosted CI environment will offer more control and security, but using cloud-based solution like GitHub Actions is easier for small applications.
